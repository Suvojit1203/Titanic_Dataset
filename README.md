# Titanic_Dataset
# The Titanic-Dataset.csv contains real-world data pertaining to the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, a vessel that tragically sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912. This historical event remains a subject of extensive study, particularly concerning the factors that influenced survival rates. The dataset, as observed from its content , is presented in a tabular format, a common structure for analytical datasets. Each row corresponds to a unique passenger, and each column details a specific attribute of that individual. Â  

# The core analytical purpose of this dataset is to construct predictive models that can estimate the probability of a passenger surviving the disaster based on their recorded characteristics. This analytical objective positions the dataset firmly within the realm of supervised machine learning, specifically as a binary classification problem.

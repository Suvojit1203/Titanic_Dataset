Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset:  
This dataset contains real-world data about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which tragically sank on its maiden voyage in April 1912. This historical event has been extensively studied, particularly regarding the factors that influenced survival rates.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset is presented in a tabular format, with each row representing a unique passenger and each column detailing a specific attribute of that individual.

Analytical Objective:
The primary purpose of this dataset is to build predictive models that can estimate the probability of a passenger surviving the disaster based on their recorded characteristics. This makes it a classic supervised machine learning problem, specifically a binary classification task (survived or did not survive).
